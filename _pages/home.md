excerpt: #"Harmonic-Percussive Disentangled Neural Audio Codec for Bandwidth Extension"
---

Welcome to this demo website, in which we display examples of extended signals we obtained thanks to the models introduced in the paper "Harmonic-Percussive Disentangled Neural Audio Codec for Bandwidth Extension", that has been submitted to ICLR 2026. These excerpts are displayed in [Audio Examples](./audio.md).

# Abstract

<html>
<div style="text-align: justify">
<p>
Neural audio codecs have emerged as effective feature extractors, providing discrete latent representations that can be modeled with language models for audio generation and processing. We address the task of bandwidth extension by leveraging the structure of these representations. Our approach disentangles codec latents through a spectrally informed harmonicâ€“percussive decomposition and performs token prediction with a transformer language model. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines, as measured by standard objective metrics.
